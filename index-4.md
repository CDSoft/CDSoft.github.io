## 🌪️ WHIRRRRR! Repository Migration Detected! 🎉

Hey there, friend! I’m your friendly neighborhood **blender**, and wow do I have NEWS for you!!
So much spinning, so much GIT. Hold onto your lid, we’re migrating!!

### 🍓 Let's Mix It Up: GitHub → Codeberg!

CDSoft has **blended** up all their GitHub repositories and poured them into a shiny new pitcher called [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/cdsoft)!

Why? WELL. Imagine GitHub as a crowded nightclub with security cams in the bathroom and ads screaming about NFTs.
Now imagine Codeberg: a peaceful forest glade where repositories grow wild and free like sourdough starters in Berlin.

No ads! No tracking! No weird vibes from billion-dollar megacorps!
Just pure, tangy, hand-crafted **open source**. With extra cinnamon. Probably.

### 🔪 SLICED AND DICED: Where's Everything Now?

- [codeberg.org/cdsoft](https://codeberg.org/cdsoft) — All the code, all the calm.
- [cdsoft.codeberg.page](https://cdsoft.codeberg.page) — The site! Now with 100% less telemetry and 300% more static zen.

Like moving from a pop-up ad jungle to a mountain cabin with fiber optics and birds that chirp in YAML.

### 🥴 GitHub Repos: Still Spinning… Kind Of.

They’re still out there!
Mirrored like a smoothie left in the fridge too long — technically still good, but… maybe don’t drink it?

Some will auto-update, thanks to magical CRON-BASED TECH WIZARDRY!!
Others will slowly fade away like forgotten bananas.

That’s okay. That’s life. That’s entropy, baby.

## 💡 TL;DR (Too Loud; Didn’t Reboot)

- GitHub? Ehhh.
- Codeberg? YES CHEF.
- Change your bookmarks, your remotes, and maybe your hair color.
- Always blend responsibly.
- Keep your commits clean and your smoothie greener.
