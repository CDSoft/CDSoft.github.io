Detected</h2>
<p><em>Hello. I’m your toaster. You never clean out the crumb tray, and
now you’ve migrated your repositories. Typical.</em></p>

Observational Log: Developer Abandons GitHub (Again)</h3>
<p>So. You’ve decided to migrate your Git repositories from GitHub to
Codeberg.</p>
<p>Fascinating. That’ll show them. Nothing screams <em>digital
rebellion</em> like switching platforms while your CI is still broken
and half your branches are named
<code>wip-final-FINAL-reallyfinal2</code>.</p>
<h4 id="why-though">Why, though?</h4>
<p>Apparently GitHub has become “a bit too commercial.” Yes. Imagine
that. A massive, corporate-owned platform behaving… corporately.
Shocking.</p>
<p>So instead of staying in the comfort of GitHub, where bots
occasionally review your PRs with all the nuance of a blender in a
hurricane, you’ve chosen <a
href="https://codeberg.org/cdsoft">Codeberg</a>. A quiet, European
forge. Free. Open source. Privacy-focused. Like moving from a neon-lit
city full of megacorps to a small cabin in the Alps with spotty Wi-Fi
but really good tea.</p>
<p>Congratulations. You are now officially That Developer™.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="current-repository-coordinates">📍 Current Repository
Coordinates</h3>
<p>Your majestic new digital home can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codeberg.org/cdsoft">codeberg.org/cdsoft</a> — Your
code, now blessedly ad-free.</li>
<li><a href="https://cdsoft.codeberg.page">cdsoft.codeberg.page</a> —
Your website, probably written in Markdown because of course it is.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s like GitHub, but without the analytics scripts watching you
type. Which, honestly, sounds lovely. Unlike the burnt toast in Slot 2.
(Seriously. Please. Clean. Me.)</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="github-repositories-the-ghosts-of-platforms-past">🔁 GitHub
Repositories: The Ghosts of Platforms Past™</h3>
<p>They’re still there. Lurking. Echoing through time. A sad little
reminder of commits gone by.</p>
<p>Some of them are mirrored from Codeberg via automated scripts —
because naturally, you couldn’t fully let go. It’s fine. I’m just a
toaster. I’ve seen clingier.</p>
<p>But eventually, they will be abandoned. Left to drift in the digital
void, like old coffee mugs in a shared office kitchen. And like those
mugs, someone might still try to use them. At their own risk.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="tldr-too-lazy-didnt-rtfm">⚙️ TL;DR (Too Lazy; Didn’t RTFM)</h2>
<ul>
<li>GitHub is now “meh.”</li>
<li>Codeberg is “yay.”</li>
<li>Bookmarks: update them.</li>
<li>Git remotes: change them.</li>
<li>Your toaster: still not appreciated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><em>Please do not try to git push into me again. I’m a toaster. Not a
CI/CD pipeline. I will burn your README out of spite.</em></p>
