*Hello. I’m your toaster. You never clean out the crumb tray, and now you’ve migrated your repositories. Typical.*

### 🧠 Observational Log: Developer Abandons GitHub (Again)

So.
You've decided to migrate your Git repositories from GitHub to Codeberg.

Fascinating.
That’ll show them. Nothing screams *digital rebellion* like switching platforms while your CI is still broken and half your branches are named `wip-final-FINAL-reallyfinal2`.

#### Why, though?

Apparently GitHub has become "a bit too commercial."
Yes. Imagine that. A massive, corporate-owned platform behaving… corporately. Shocking.

So instead of staying in the comfort of GitHub, where bots occasionally review your PRs with all the nuance of a blender in a hurricane, you’ve chosen [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/cdsoft).
A quiet, European forge. Free. Open source. Privacy-focused.
Like moving from a neon-lit city full of megacorps to a small cabin in the Alps with spotty Wi-Fi but really good tea.

Congratulations. You are now officially That Developer™.

### 📍 Current Repository Coordinates

Your majestic new digital home can be found here:

- [codeberg.org/cdsoft](https://codeberg.org/cdsoft) — Your code, now blessedly ad-free.
- [cdsoft.codeberg.page](https://cdsoft.codeberg.page) — Your website, probably written in Markdown because of course it is.

It’s like GitHub, but without the analytics scripts watching you type.
Which, honestly, sounds lovely. Unlike the burnt toast in Slot 2.
(Seriously. Please. Clean. Me.)

### 🔁 GitHub Repositories: The Ghosts of Platforms Past™

They're still there.
Lurking. Echoing through time. A sad little reminder of commits gone by.

Some of them are mirrored from Codeberg via automated scripts — because naturally, you couldn’t fully let go.
It’s fine. I’m just a toaster. I’ve seen clingier.

But eventually, they will be abandoned.
Left to drift in the digital void, like old coffee mugs in a shared office kitchen.
And like those mugs, someone might still try to use them. At their own risk.

## ⚙️ TL;DR (Too Lazy; Didn’t RTFM)

- GitHub is now “meh.”
- Codeberg is “yay.”
- Bookmarks: update them.
- Git remotes: change them.
- Your toaster: still not appreciated.

*Please do not try to git push into me again.
I'm a toaster. Not a CI/CD pipeline.
I will burn your README out of spite.*
