## 🌀 Don't Panic†

> † *Standard advice for most interdimensional technical documentation, catastrophic starship failures, and trying to merge two git branches after three months of neglect.*

In a peculiar quadrant of the digital multiverse, known to locals as “the Internet”††,

> †† *Not to be confused with The Outerweb, a mythological network believed by Vogons to be powered entirely by bureaucracy and screaming.*

— a developer by the name of CDSoft woke up one morning with the inexplicable urge to **move all his repositories** to another Git forge.

> *This kind of thing happens sometimes. It’s the leading cause of developer-induced existential migration, second only to “accidentally deleting `main` on a Friday.”*

### ☄️ Why leave GitHub?

GitHub, while a decent place to **meet other code-based lifeforms**,

> *Although some entities on GitHub are, in fact, bots trained to generate unit tests for coffee machines.*

had begun to feel... crowded. Commercial. Watched.

> *A lot like standing in the middle of a Vogon poetry recital with an "I ❤️ Clean Code" sticker on your forehead.*

So I packed up, zipped my towel, made a full backup (yes, even the `.gitignore`), and sailed off to **Codeberg**.

> *Codeberg: A small European forge, often mistaken for an actual iceberg by less observant developers. No penguins. Just Git.*

### 🛸 What is Codeberg?

Codeberg is like GitHub’s cool, privacy-conscious cousin who lives in a cozy alpine cabin and only writes open-source code while sipping organic tea.

> *Allegedly maintained by sentient alpine marmots trained in DevOps.*

No ads. No tracking. No corporate tentacles slithering through your pull requests.

> *Fun fact: “Corporate Tentacles” is also the name of a punk band formed by rogue CI/CD pipelines in 2023.*

Just **pure, unfiltered Git** — the way Linus probably intended while riding a comet through the kernelverse.

> *Unverified legend. May involve exaggeration and Scandinavian weather.*

### 🛰️ Where am I now?

You’ll find me peacefully orbiting at:

- [codeberg.org/cdsoft](https://codeberg.org/cdsoft)

> *Includes actual, functioning repositories and not just a README that says “WIP” for five years.*

- [cdsoft.codeberg.page](https://cdsoft.codeberg.page)

> *My personal site. Now 73% more static and 98% less JavaScript.*

### 🪐 And what about the old GitHub stuff?

Still there. Ghosts in the machine.

> *Some say if you `git clone` them on a full moon, they still work. Others say that’s just `rsync`.*

Some mirrors will remain synced through a process only describable as **"cron-powered temporal Git voodoo"**.

> *Involves `tmux`, `xargs`, and caffeine.*

But one day, like all forgotten CI pipelines, they will quietly vanish into the abyss.

> *Except for that one repo with the typos — that one is eternal.*

## 🧠 TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Rebase)

- I left GitHub.

> *No hard feelings. It’s not you, it’s your terms of service.*

- I'm on Codeberg now.

> *It’s calm, open-sourcey, and they don’t yell at you in JavaScript.*

- Update your links, your clones, and maybe your life choices while you're at it.

> *Optional. But recommended.*

- Never, ever forget your towel.

> *Especially when pushing to `origin`.*
