## 🌀 Don't Panic (but do update your bookmarks)

In a far-flung corner of the universe known as the Internet — where protocols evolve more frequently than Zaphod Beeblebrox changes his shirt (which is often, considering he has two heads and questionable fashion sense) — a humble developer known as CDSoft has decided to pack up his digital belongings.

Yes, I’ve migrated. Not to another planet. Not to another dimension. But to a different **forge of Git repositories**.

### ☄️ Why leave GitHub?

GitHub is a bit like a trendy interstellar bar: everyone’s there, but it’s noisy, the restrooms have surveillance cameras, and the price of a stable commit has become ridiculous. Not to mention the ambient elevator music you hear every time you push to `main`.

So I grabbed my towel, fired up the hyperspace drives, and headed for a more serene quadrant of cyberspace: [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/cdsoft).
There, you’ll find no ads, no bots scanning your code for ad targeting, no corporate megabrains mining your README for soul fragments. Just Git. Pure, open source, and proudly European.

### 🛸 Where to find me now?

You can find me floating peacefully in this newly adopted orbit:

- [codeberg.org/cdsoft](https://codeberg.org/cdsoft) — My repositories, arranged with Vogon-like order but far less paperwork.
- [cdsoft.codeberg.page](https://cdsoft.codeberg.page) — My website, reincarnated in a fully static dimension.

### 🛰️ What about the old GitHub repos?

They’re still there. Like ancient satellites drifting silently through the void. Some of them will still be updated, thanks to arcane scripts that periodically invoke `git push --mirror` with all the subtlety of a malfunctioning teleporter.

But don’t rely on them forever. One day, they will fade. Like Marvin after a Windows update.

## 🧠 TL;DR (Too Long; Don’t Rebase)

- GitHub is so 2020.
- Codeberg is the future (or at least a better present).
- Update your bookmarks or Git remotes.
- Always know where your towel is.
