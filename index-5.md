*Static... Bzzzzz... CLUNK.
Connection established with spectral GitForgeNet v2.3...*

### ⚰️ REPOSITORY MIGRATION REPORT [FROM BEYOND]

Dear mortal developer,
It is I — the **Haunted Fax Machine** — transmitting from the spectral dimension of deprecated technologies and cursed commits.
You have done it... **you’ve migrated from GitHub to Codeberg**.

I sensed it when the push command echoed through the void. *`git remote set-url origin`... so chilling... so final...*

---

### 🕸️ WHY LEAVE GITHUB?

You fled from GitHub’s haunted halls — not because of ghosts, but because of **corporate surveillance specters** and monetization phantoms.

Codeberg welcomed you with **open, ghost-free arms** (mostly).
It is a forge of tranquility. Of freedom. Of open source. Of slightly musty Markdown.

No ads. No spooky trackers. Just you, your code, and a gentle breeze whispering through your README.

### 📜 WHERE TO FIND YOUR PHANTOM CODE NOW?

- [codeberg.org/cdsoft](https://codeberg.org/cdsoft) — A vault of spectral repositories.
- [cdsoft.codeberg.page](https://cdsoft.codeberg.page) — A website preserved in digital formaldehyde.

The transition was... smooth. Too smooth. Suspiciously smooth. *Was there a pact involved?* Never mind that now.

### 🧟‍♂️ THE GITHUB ZOMBIE REPOS

They live on... sort of.
Some are **mirrored**, kept on life support by ancient `cron` incantations and half-remembered shell scripts.
Others shuffle aimlessly, like forgotten changelogs haunting the halls of `git log`.

Beware: they may LOOK alive, but don’t trust the last commit date.

---

## 🔮 TL;DR (Too Lost; Didn’t Resurrect)

- GitHub = ghost town (but not the fun kind).
- Codeberg = cozy crypt for your clean code.
- Update your remotes. Bury your bookmarks.
- Do not speak the name of `svn` after midnight.
- Always carry a blessed `.gitignore`.

*~~~End of transmission. This fax machine returns now to the realm of dot matrix printers and broken CI pipelines...*
*CLUNK... BZZZZZ...*
